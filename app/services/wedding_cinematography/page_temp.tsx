        When it comes to choosing the right package for your wedding day – we do
        our best to make the selection process as easy as possible. We offer
        three categories of services: Wedding Videography, Wedding Photography,
        and a combination of both. Each category has three general packages that
        are designed in a way to provide you with the best experience possible.
        All of the packages are hourly based and differ in the amount of footage
        delivered. In summary, whether you choose the least or most advanced
        package, we will create memories that you remember forever.

        Our videography packages are focused on delivering a cinematic wedding
        film that tells a story of your special day. The films are 3-6 minutes
        long and will be delivered between 4-6 weeks after the wedding. Length
        of the film depends on the size of your wedding, number of hours you’ve
        hired us for, and the amount of events occurring through the day. For
        the addition features, please see the adds on section below the
        packages. All of the packages can be customized at any time.

        An engagement photoshoot is a great way for a couple to meet their
        future wedding photographers. We believe that all couples are different
        and require a specific approach in order to get the best footage
        possible. Through the photoshoot, we learn more about you as a couple,
        your love story, stylistic preferences, and simply prepare you to be
        comfortable in front of the camera. Moreover, it allows us to be as
        creative as possible without worrying about timing and other factors
        throughout the wedding day. Our engagement shoots usually take around
        2-3 hours and take place in parks, museums, beaches, botanic gardens,
        deserts, mountains and other iconic places in the Los Angeles area. The
        locations we choose from are Malibu Coast, Venice, Beverly Hills, DTLA,
        Bel Air, San Pedro, Joshua Tree, Big Bear mountain and many more.
        Lastly, we want to let you know that we are always open to new
        suggestions and will do our best to shoot at your preferred location!

        Weddings can often come in large sizes, as such, a second videographer
        or photographer can come in handy. They are a significant help to the
        lead shooter and make the entire filming process easier and faster for
        the couple. The second shooter also doubles the amount of footage,
        making sure every priceless moment has been captured.

        Having shot over 100 weddings, we’ve noticed that weddings have a
        tendency to run a little late, and there are cases where a few extra
        hours wouldn’t hurt. Sometimes weddings may have 2 or even 3 locations
        throughout the day and transit time between them may be significant,
        especially in Los Angeles. The extra time will ensure that the shooting
        team has enough time to properly set up for the important moments, plan
        a specific shot, organize the crowd for group photos, and perform in the
        most efficient way.
